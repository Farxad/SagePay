2000	NOTAUTHED	The Authorisation was Declined by the bank.	The Authorisation attempt was Declined by the cardholder's card-issuing bank.

You will receive this error message for usually one or two reasons - if your Terminal ID's have not been set up correctly with your merchant bank or if we are experiencing intermittent authorisation issues where we have not been able to contact your merchant bank when requesting authorisation. This will be due to the transaction timing out and will result in transactions not being authorised and being registered as failed payments.

If this error message has only appeared on one transaction, then please retry the transaction again.

3002	INVALID	The VPSTxId is invalid.	This system message is generated when you have not supplied the correct value in the VPSTxId field. It is likely that you received this message when you were attempting to perform a related action to an original transaction (such as a REPEAT, RELEASE, VOID, REFUND etc.) as the VPSTxId, which uniquely identifies a transaction to the Sage Pay system, is generated by us and returned back to you.	To correct this issue, you will need to check your code to ensure you are submitting the correct value. Also check to see if you have submitted the full VPSTxId, including the hyphens and curly brackets.	
3002b		A valid ##### value is required.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3003	INVALID	The Currency is invalid.	Currency fields should contain 3-letter ISO 4217 codes e.g. GBP for UK Sterling, USD for U.S Dollars. If you submit a value which is not in line with the ISO 4217 codes or is not set up on your account, you will get this system message	Please check you code to ensure the Currency field of your POST contains a valid currency code, you may need to contact our customer services team to check which currencies are set up on your Sage Pay account.	
3003b		A valid ##### value is required, this should be either ##### or #####.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3004	INVALID	The Amount is invalid	This system message is generated if the amount field contains any other characters than numerics or is not correctly formatted to the correct number of decimal places for the specified currency.	You will need to make sure that you are sending the correct values for example: 123.45 4567.89 0.34 12.30 but not the values 123.456 4,567.89 .34 12.3 Check your code to ensure you are formatting the Amount field correctly	
3004b		You must provide at least one ##### element within ##### node.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3005	INVALID	The Amount is outside the mininum and maximum limits.	The Sage Pay system has a maximum and minimum acceptable transaction value which are 100,000GBP and 0.01GBP respectively, with approximate equivalents in other currencies. Unfortunately, we are unable to process transaction values outside of these ranges.  You will receive this system message if you are passing an amount that is outside of the supported range.	You will need to ensure that the Amount field value which you are submitting is between 0.01 to 100000.00 or equivalent for other currencies	
3005b		XML does not match the protocol. ##### tag either not required for this command or XML structure is incorrect.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3006	INVALID	The fractional part of the Amount is invalid for the specified currency.	If you have sent an Amount field with an invalid number of digits after the decimal place. e.g. 123.456 instead of 123.46, then you will receive this system message. You may also get this if you send fractional values to currencies that do not have minor units (like Japanese Yen, JPY, which only accepts whole number amounts)	The Amount you are passing has more digits after than the decimal point than is allowed. Please look into the content of the field and ensure you only pass values to the allowed number of decimal places for that currency.	
3006b		##### must be a numeric value.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3007	INVALID	The RelatedSecurityKey format invalid.	The RelatedSecurityKey is a unique security value for each transaction and would have been sent back to your server in the status response of the original transaction. If you have received this system message, it is likely that you are attempting to send an automated REFUND, REPEAT or AUTHORISE request against the original transaction from your server (i.e you are performing any of the above outside of the My Sage Pay admin area) and the RelatedSecurityKey does not match with what we have in the database for this transaction.	You will need to check that you are sending the correct SecurityKey of the original transaction in this field. This value is 10 alphanumeric characters long and should be retrieved from your database.	
3007b		##### must be a numeric value with up to 2 decimal places.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3008	INVALID	The Vendor or Vendorname format is invalid.	The Vendor field should contain the Vendor Name which you specified on your application form when you signed up to Sage Pay. If you did not provide a vendor name, then it would have been supplied by Sage Pay. This is an important field as it allows us to identify and process the transaction through your account.	"All transactions which are posted to the Sage Pay system will contain a ""Vendor"" field which should contain your unique vendor name. You will need to check that this field is sending the correct reference. This will always be 16 characters or less, and only contain letters and numbers with no spaces or unusual characters."	
3008b		##### supplied is too long.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3009	MALFORMED	The VendorTxCode is missing.	A VendorTxCode has not been provided within your transaction registration. The VendorTxCode is a required field which is generated by you as a unique identifier for the transaction.	You will need to check your code to ensure that you are sending this value or that the data is in the correct field. If you are using our Form integration method, you may also sometimes receive this message if your Encryption Password is incorrect, so we would suggest you check this information as well.	
3009b		##### is an invalid date format. Please use format dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss.		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3010	INVALID	The RelatedVPSTxId is invalid.	The VPSTxId uniquely identifies the original transaction which you are attempting to REFUND, REPEAT or AUTHORISE through the Sage Pay system. If you are attempting to perform these functions automatically (i.e you are performing any of the above outside of the My Sage Pay admin area) then you will need to submit the VPSTxId of the original transaction in a field called RelatedVPSTxId. If you have not supplied the correct value in the RelatedVPSTxId field, have not submitted it in full or it is incorrectly formatted then you will receive this system message when our systems try to validate the post.	You will need to check your code to ensure you are submitting the correct VPSTxId relating to the original transaction.  This value would have been sent back to you in the status response of the original transaction from Sage Pay. Your system should be storing this information and be retrieving it from your database when performing the above actions.	
3010b		Duplicate Key		There is a problem with the details that have been supplied. Please check and retry.	
3011	INVALID	The NotificationURL format is invalid.	The NotificationURL which you have provided is not recognised by the Sage Pay servers and therefore we cannot send you all the transaction completion information.	The NotificationURL field must contain a Fully Qualified Domain Name pointing to the externally visible page on your site. You will need to review your code and change the URL to only use a fully qualified URL which must be http:// or https:// and be accessible.	
3012	INVALID	The RelatedVendorTxCode format invalid.	The RelatedVendorTxCode should contain the VendorTxCode of the original transaction against which you trying to REFUND, REPEAT or AUTHORISE. If this value is incorrect or invalid, then our system will be unable to identify the original transaction.	You will need to check your code to ensure you are retrieving the correct VendorTxCode from your database and sending it through in the RelatedVendorTxCode field. It should be less than 40 characters long, contain only letters and numbers and match the value passed in the original transaction.	
3013	MALFORMED	The Description is missing.	Your transaction registration must contain a Description field which contains a brief (100 characters or less) description of the transaction being performed. This provides a description of the goods purchased is displayed on the payment page as the customer enters their card details, and within the My Sage Pay admin area.	This is a required value within the Protocol and you will need to check your code to ensure that you are sending this information for each transaction you register with Sage Pay.	
3014	INVALID	The TxType or PaymentType is invalid.	The TxType field determines how the transaction will be processed by the Sage Pay system.
