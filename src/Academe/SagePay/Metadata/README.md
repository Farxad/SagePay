The error-codes.tsv are the errors that SagePay will produce, as collected from a number of
different sources. I suspect it is nowhere near complete, but we can keep adding messages as
we find them.

Every time we visit the SagePay site, we find different lists of error codes and messages.
Each visit has some new messages, and some missing, so the sets all overlap, but at least
the messages are consistent with the codes. Except, some of the messages are truncated with
and ellipsis, depending on which list you look at and which direction the wind is blowing
today.

Slowly we built up the list with merges. This is THE most complete list of SagePay error
codes that I know of. It does not record reasons and solutions for each message yet. That
is available for some messages, so it may be worth pulling them in too.

Please note that explanations and suggestions solutions in error-codes.tsv can be found
on the SagePay error codes tool here:
